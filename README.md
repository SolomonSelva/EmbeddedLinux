# Embedded Linux on BeagleBone Black  

This repository contains hands-on projects and experiments for Embedded Linux development on the **BeagleBone Black** (AM335x SoC). It covers key concepts, boot processes, device trees, hardware interfacing, and networking.

## Topics Covered  
- **Boot Process & U-Boot**: Understanding ROM, U-Boot, SPL, MLO, and kernel booting.  
- **Kernel & Bootloader Compilation**: Step-by-step compilation and testing.  
- **AM335x Subsystems**: GPIO, I2C, MMC, boot modes, platform devices, and ARM-board configurations.  
- **Linux Device Tree**: Writing and modifying device tree files.  
- **Boot Modes & OS Deployment**: eMMC OS updates, serial booting (UART), TFTP boot, and NFS boot.  
- **Networking & Build Systems**: BeagleBone networking, BusyBox, and Buildroot configuration.  
- **Hardware Interfacing & 'C' Development**:  
  - GPIO programming  
  - LED, 7-segment, LCD interfacing  
  - MPU6050 sensor tilt sensing  
  - EEPROM programming  
  - I2C tools on BBB  
  - uEnv.txt customization and testing
